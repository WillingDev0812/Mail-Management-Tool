Frequently asked questions
==========================

Informational
-------------

Where to ask questions?
```````````````````````

First, please read this FAQ to check if your question is listed here.
Simple questions best fit in our `Matrix`_ room.
For more complex questions, you can always open a `new issue`_ on GitHub.
We actively monitor the issues list.


My installation is broken!
``````````````````````````

We're sorry to hear that. Please check for common mistakes and troubleshooting
advice in the `Technical issues`_ section of this page.

I think I found a bug!
``````````````````````

If you did not manage to solve the issue using this FAQ and there is not any 
`open issues`_ describing the same problem, you can continue to open a
`new issue`_ on GitHub.

I want a new feature or enhancement!
````````````````````````````````````

Great! We are always open for suggestions. We currently maintain two tags:

- `Enhancement issues`_: Typically used for optimization of features in the project.
- `Feature request issues`_: For implementing new functionality,
  plugins and applications.

Please check if your idea (or something similar) is already mentioned there.
If there is one open, you can choose to vote with a thumbs up, so we can
estimate the popular demand. Please refrain from writing comments like
*"me too"* as it clobbers the actual discussion.

If you can't find anything similar, you can open a `new issue`_.
Please also share (where applicable):

- Use case: how does this improve the project?
- Any research done on the subject. Perhaps some links to upstream website,
  reference implementations etc.

Why does my feature/bug take so long to solve?
``````````````````````````````````````````````

You should be aware that creating, maintaining and expanding a mail server
distribution requires a lot of effort. Mail servers are highly exposed to hacking attempts,
open relay scanners, spam and malware distributors etc. We need to work in a safe way and
have to prevent pushing out something quickly.

We currently maintain a strict work flow:

#. Someone writes a solution and sends a pull request;
#. We use Travis-CI fore some very basic building and testing;
#. The pull request needs to be code-reviewed and tested by at least two members
   from the contributors team.
  
Please consider that this project is mostly developed in people their free time.
We thank you for your understanding and patience.

I would to donate (for a feature)
`````````````````````````````````

Donations are welcome at the `patreon`_ account of the project lead. It will be used to pay
for infra structure and project related costs. If there are leftovers, it will be distributed
among the developers.

It is not yet possible to pay for a specific feature. We don't have
any bounty system implemented. Feel free to come with suggestions in
our ongoing `project management`_ discussion issue.
