Mailu
=====

.. image:: assets/logo.png

Mailu is a simple yet full-featured mail server as a set of Docker images.
It is free software (both as in free beer and as in free speech), open to
suggestions and external contributions. The project aims at providing people
with an easily setup, easily maintained and full-featured mail server while
not shipping proprietary software nor unrelated features often found in
popular groupware.

The documentation is written as part of the repository and evolves with it.
Make sure that you access the proper version of the documentation, based on
the version of Mailu that you are running.
