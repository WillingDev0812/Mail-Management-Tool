New override system for Rspamd. In the old system, all files were placed in the Rspamd overrides folder.
These overrides would override everything, including the Mailu Rspamd config.

Now overrides are placed in /overrides.
If you use your own map files, change the location to /override/myMapFile.map in the corresponding conf file.
It works as following.
* If the override file overrides a Mailu defined config file,
  it will be included in the Mailu config file with lowest priority.
  It will merge with existing sections.
* If the override file does not override a Mailu defined config file,
  then the file will be placed in the rspamd local.d folder.
  It will merge with existing sections.

For more information, see the description of the local.d folder on the rspamd website:
