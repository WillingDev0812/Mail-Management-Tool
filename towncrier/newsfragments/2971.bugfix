Switch from fts-xapian to fts-flatcurve. This should address the problem with indexes getting too big and will be the default in dovecot 2.4

You can dispose of old indexes using a command such as:

find /mailu/mail -type d -name xapian-indexes -prune -exec rm -r {} \+

And re-index using:

docker compose exec imap doveadm index -A '*'
