Reverse proxy documentation has been updated to reflect new security hardening from PR#1959.
If you do not set the required header, Mailu will not have access to the real ip address of the connecting client.
This means that rate limiting will not properly work. You can also not use fail2ban. 
It is very important to set this header when using a reverse proxy.
