Reverse proxy documentation has been updated to reflect new security hardening from PR#1959.
If you do not set the configuration parameters in Mailu what reverse proxy header to trust,
then Mailu will not have access to the real ip address of the connecting client.
This means that rate limiting will not properly work. You can also not use fail2ban. 
It is very important to configure this when using a reverse proxy.
