{% call macros.panel("info", "Step 2 - expose Mailu to the world") %}
<p>A mail server must be exposed to the world to receive emails, send emails,
and let users access their mailboxes. Mailu has some flexibility in the way
you expose it to the world.</p>

<p>Among Mailu services, the <em>front</em> server is the one accepting connections,
be it directly from the outside world, through a reverse proxy or in any
complex configuration that you might want to setup. It needs to listen on some
IP addresses in order to expose its public services. You must at least setup
an IPv4 or an IPv6 address if you wish to access Mailu.</p>

<p><span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> You must use specific addresses, please
avoid generic all-interfaces addresses like <em>0.0.0.0</em> or <em>::</em>.</p>
