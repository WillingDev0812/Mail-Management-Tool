<p>Docker Compose expects a project file, named <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
in a project directory. First create your project directory.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /path/to/project
</pre></code>

<p>Then download the project file. A side configuration file makes it easier
to read and check the configuration variables generated by the wizard.</p>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/project
wget https://...
wget https://...
</pre></code>
{% endcall %}


{% call macros.panel("info", "Step 2 - Review the configuration") %}
<p>We did not insert any malicious code on purpose in the configurations we
distribute, but your download could have been intercepted, or our wizard
website could have been compromised, so make sure you check the configuration
files before going any further.</p>

<p>When you are done checking them, check them one last time.</p>
{% endcall %}

{% call macros.panel("info", "Step 3 - Start the Compose project") %}
<p>To start your compose project, simply run the Docker Compose <code>up</code>
command.</p>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/project
docker-compose up -d
</pre></code>
{% endcall %}
